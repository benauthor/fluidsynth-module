# fluidsynth-module

Turns your small computer into a piano. Or a marimba. Or a string section. Whatever you like.

I like this [Rhodes](https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/1489).


## Come again?

This is a [Patchbox OS](https://blokas.io/patchbox-os/) module that runs [Fluidsynth](https://www.fluidsynth.org/). You might want this if you are running Patchbox on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) wearing a [Pisound](https://blokas.io/pisound/) hat.

## Um, ok?

Drop any soundfont files you want to use in `/usr/share/sounds/sf2/`
or `/usr/share/sounds/sf3` as appropriate. After you select Fluidsynth in the Patchbox module manager, choose your desired soundfront from the list.

Then plug in your MIDI keyboard and play beautiful music.
